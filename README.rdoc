= Heroku Backup Command

Plugin that provides the backup command for the heroku gem. This allows you
to automate the process of backing up bundles to S3.

== Installation

    $ heroku plugins:install git@github.com:saturnflyer/heroku_backup.git

== Setup

This plugin requires two environment variables:

    S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID

    S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

You can also still use the old style - namely, using +config/s3.yml+
(the S3 config file used with the paperclip gem).

You'll also need to make sure that you've enabled the Single or Unlimited Bundle 
addon for your app:

    $ heroku addons:add bundles:single
    
If you have the Unlimited bundles addon enabled, the Backup plugin will not 
destroy any of your bundles on Heroku.

== Usage

From your project's root directory:

    $ heroku backup

That'll make the magic happen.
